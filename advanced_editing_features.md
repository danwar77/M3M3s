# Future Expansion: Advanced Meme Editing Features

This document outlines potential advanced editing features that could be integrated into the `MemeDisplayScreen` of the Flutter Meme Generator application to provide users with more creative control and enhance the overall meme creation experience.

## 1. Enhanced Text Customization

*   **Custom Font Selection & Management:**
    *   Allow users to choose from a curated list of pre-loaded custom fonts (e.g., popular meme fonts, Google Fonts packaged with the app).
    *   Consider a system for users to import their own font files (more complex).
    *   UI: A dropdown menu with font previews or a dedicated font selection panel.
*   **Advanced Text Styling:**
    *   **Comprehensive Color Picker:** Integrate a more advanced color picker (e.g., wheel, RGB/HSV sliders with opacity control) for text fill.
    *   **Stroke/Outline:** Allow users to add a stroke (outline) to text, with customizable color and thickness. This is a very common feature in meme text.
    *   **Shadow Effects:** Provide more granular control over text shadows (e.g., X/Y offset, blur radius, spread, color, opacity).
    *   **Text Background:** Option to add a solid or semi-transparent background color to text elements, potentially with padding.
    *   **Text Alignment:** Explicit controls for aligning text (left, center, right, justify) within its bounding box, especially crucial if text boxes become draggable and resizable.
    *   **Letter Spacing & Line Spacing:** Allow fine-tuning of character spacing and line height for better text composition.
    *   **Text Case Transformation:** Buttons for quickly changing text to UPPERCASE, lowercase, or Title Case, beyond the current hardcoded uppercase.
*   **Text Transformation & Effects:**
    *   Options for text warp, arc, bend, or other creative path-based text transformations.
    *   Gradient text fills.

## 2. Image Enhancements & Manipulation

*   **Image Filters:**
    *   Apply common image filters to the base meme image/template (e.g., grayscale, sepia, brightness, contrast, saturation, invert, blur, pixelate).
    *   UI: A scrollable list or carousel of filter previews applied live or to a thumbnail.
*   **Image Adjustments:**
    *   Sliders for fine-tuning brightness, contrast, saturation, exposure, and sharpness of the base image.
    *   Cropping and rotation tools for the base image, allowing users to reframe or straighten templates/uploads.
    *   Flip image (horizontal/vertical).

## 3. Layer Management & Interactive Elements

*   **Draggable & Resizable Text/Elements:**
    *   Allow users to freely drag and reposition text boxes on the canvas using touch gestures.
    *   Enable interactive resizing of text boxes (and other elements like stickers) using corner or edge handles.
    *   Rotation gestures for text boxes and other elements.
*   **Multiple Text Layers:**
    *   Support for adding, managing, and editing more than two independent text elements on the meme.
*   **Sticker/Image Overlays:**
    *   Allow users to add small images or pre-defined stickers (e.g., emojis, popular meme cutouts) onto the main meme image.
    *   UI: A gallery of stickers to choose from, potentially categorized.
    *   Support for users to upload their own images as stickers.
*   **Layer Ordering:**
    *   If multiple text elements, stickers, or shapes are added, provide a way to manage their stacking order (e.g., bring to front, send to back, move forward, move backward).
    *   UI: A simple layer panel or context menu options.

## 4. Canvas & Drawing Tools (More Advanced)

*   **Basic Drawing Tools:**
    *   Pen/Brush tool for freehand drawing on the meme, with selectable color and brush size/type.
    *   Eraser tool.
*   **Shape Tools:**
    *   Ability to add basic geometric shapes (rectangles, circles, lines, arrows) with customizable fill and stroke.

## 5. Usability & Workflow Enhancements

*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:**
    *   Implement a history stack to allow users to undo and redo their editing actions. This is crucial for a good creative experience.
*   **Zoom & Pan Canvas:**
    *   Allow users to zoom into the meme canvas for more precise editing and pan around when zoomed.
*   **Aspect Ratio Control & Presets:**
    *   Allow users to choose different aspect ratios for their memes (e.g., square for Instagram, 16:9 for Twitter, freeform).
    *   Provide common social media presets.
*   **Template Customization Save:**
    *   Ability for users to save their customized version of a template (with specific text placements/styles) for quick reuse.
*   **Drafts:**
    *   Save memes as drafts locally or to the backend to continue editing later.

## Implementation Considerations:

*   **Performance:** Advanced rendering, especially with multiple layers, filters, and real-time previews of draggable elements, can be performance-intensive. Careful optimization, potentially using lower-quality previews during active manipulation, will be key.
*   **UI/UX Complexity:** Adding many features can quickly clutter the UI. A thoughtful and intuitive design for the editing interface will be paramount, possibly using context-sensitive toolbars or panels.
*   **State Management:** Will require a significantly more complex state management solution to handle all the editable properties, layers, history stack, and interactions.
*   **Rendering Engine:** For highly advanced features like complex text transformations, vector drawing, or sophisticated layer blending, relying solely on Flutter's basic `Stack` and `Text` widgets might become limiting. Exploring `CustomPaint` with direct `Canvas` operations, or even integrating specialized Flutter graphics rendering packages (e.g., a custom painter framework or a 2D game engine for canvas control), might be necessary.
*   **Gesture Handling:** Implementing draggable, resizable, and rotatable elements requires robust gesture detection and handling (`GestureDetector` with `onPanUpdate`, `onScaleUpdate`, etc.).

These features, if implemented, would significantly expand the creative possibilities for users, transforming the application into a much more powerful and versatile meme editing tool. Each major feature listed here could be a substantial development effort on its own.
