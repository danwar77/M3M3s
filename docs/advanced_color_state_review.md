# Advanced Color Picker: State Variable Review

## Date: 2025-05-31

## 1. Objective
To confirm that the existing state variables in `_MemeDisplayScreenState` are sufficient for managing the colors selected via the planned advanced color picker for both text fill and text stroke.

## 2. Existing State Variables for Color
The following state variables are already defined in `_MemeDisplayScreenState` in `meme_display_screen.dart`:

*   `Color _textColor = Colors.white;` (intended for text fill)
*   `Color _textStrokeColor = Colors.black;` (intended for text stroke/outline)

## 3. Planned Advanced Color Picker Interaction
As per `advanced_color_picker_plan.md`, the advanced color picker (e.g., from the `flutter_colorpicker` package) will be launched in a dialog. Upon color selection and confirmation in the dialog, the chosen color will update either `_textColor` or `_textStrokeColor`, depending on whether the user was picking a fill or a stroke color.

## 4. Conclusion
The existing state variables `_textColor` and `_textStrokeColor` are **sufficient** for storing the colors selected by the advanced color picker. No new, separate state variables are required for this purpose. The advanced picker will act as an alternative input method to modify these existing state values.

This step confirms the adequacy of the current state management for color properties in relation to the planned advanced color picker feature.
